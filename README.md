# Workshop on Software Development and Grant Writing

### Workshop Overview

Join us for an insightful workshop hosted by the **Strudel Lab** at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA. This workshop brings together experts from software engineering and grant writing to explore the emotional aspects of software development and the role of language in grant proposal success.

### Keynote Sessions

#### Understanding Emotions in Software Development
- **Speaker:** Dr. Alexander Serebrenik, Professor, Eindhoven University of Technology
- **Date & Time:** Tomorrow, 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM
- **Location:** Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA

Software developers are known to experience a wide range of emotions while performing development tasks. Emotions are closely tied to two major aspects of software engineering: problem-solving and communication within development teams. This talk will provide an overview of recent research (2021-2024) into how emotions are experienced and expressed during software development, including methodologies for studying them and tools used in such research.

#### The Role of Language in Grant Writing Success
- **Speaker:** Dr. Huilian Sophie Qiu, Research Assistant Professor, Northwestern University
- **Date & Time:** Tomorrow, 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM
- **Location:** Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA

Grants play a crucial role in advancing medical science, but the impact of language in grant proposals on funding decisions is still not well understood. Recent research has shown a significant rise in the use of promotional language in NIH grant proposals. In this talk, Dr. Qiu will discuss studies that analyze over 11,000 funded and rejected grant proposals to explore whether promotional language is associated with successful funding outcomes. The talk will also cover recent work on automatically predicting the outcomes of grant applications.
